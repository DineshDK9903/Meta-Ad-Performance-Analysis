# Meta-Ad-Performance-Analysis

🧭 Overview

This project analyzes Meta (Facebook & Instagram) Ad Performance Data to measure campaign effectiveness and optimize marketing strategies.
It demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from data loading and exploration in Python, through visualization in Power BI, to storytelling using Gamma.
The goal is to identify which campaigns, audiences, and creatives drive the best results and ROI.

📂 Dataset

Source: Meta Ads performance data (exported from Meta Ads Manager or public dataset).

Fields: Campaign Name, Ad Set, Ad Name, Impressions, Clicks, CTR, Cost per Click (CPC), Conversions, Cost per Conversion, and Spend.

Objective: To uncover patterns and KPIs that explain campaign success or underperformance and help optimize future ad spend.

🪜 Project Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Checked data structure, types, and completeness.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed metrics like CTR, CPC, and Conversion Rate.

Identified top-performing campaigns, ad sets, and demographics.

Visualized trends and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing or inconsistent entries in cost and conversion data.

Standardized campaign/ad names.

Removed outliers and formatted numerical columns correctly.

4. Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

📢 Campaign Performance Overview

💰 Spend vs ROI by Campaign

🎯 CTR and Conversion Rate Trends

👥 Audience & Device Performance

📆 Daily/Monthly Performance Summary

Enabled dynamic filters for campaign, ad set, and date ranges.

5. Report & Presentation

Compiled a detailed report summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations.

Designed a Gamma presentation to effectively communicate:

Campaign objectives and KPIs

Key insights from EDA and dashboard

Optimization recommendations for better ROI

📊 Results & Insights

Identified top 3 high-performing campaigns delivering maximum ROI.

Discovered that mobile users had higher engagement but lower conversion than desktop users.
